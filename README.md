# IoT-System-with-Crop-Prediction-ML
Monitors and detects soil parameters using Internet of Things  in order to determine if the area is being well irrigated,  with a Machine Learning module which  uses these values to predict the crop that should be planted in that area.

I would appreciate it if this was only used as a reference.
